# Handrawn-image-recognition
Draw! is an online platform that challenges users to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to guess what the drawings represent. The model is trained on the largest doodling dataset in the world, which is compiled by Google and contains thousands of drawings from across 14 categories. Implemented through the use of Python and Keras, the recognition in Draw! is performed by a classifier that takes the user input, given as a sequence of strokes of points in x and y, and recognizes the object category that the user tried to draw.
